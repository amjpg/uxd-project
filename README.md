Designed a user-friendly website for a community-focused cafe, art gallery and social services business client. I developed this product by going through the steps of the user centered design lifecycle; I conducted user research to develop personas, guiding the overall design process. Created a comprehensive information architecture using a site map and designed a high-fidelity prototype to showcase upcoming events, social services and artist showcases. The primary goal of this project was to make a user centered website design, for ease of access across all users regardless of the technology experience. Used PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio and Canva.
